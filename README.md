# Forest Fire Prediction using Machine Learning
# Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict forest fires based on meteorological and environmental factors.

# Dataset
The Algerian Forest Fires dataset is used, containing features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and fire weather indices.

# Preprocessing
- Missing values filled with mean
- Non-essential columns dropped
- Target variable converted to integers

# Models
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

# Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
