#Forest fire prediction using machine learning

#overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict forest fires based on meteorological and environmental factors.

#dataset
The Algerian Forest Fires dataset is used, containing features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and fire weather indices.

- Non-essential columns dropped
- Target variable converted to integers

#models
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

#Evaluation
